## Introduction

The Employees System Project demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts in Python. It encompasses three primary classes, each serving a distinct purpose:

### Employee

The `Employee` class represents an individual employee with the following attributes:

- `name`: The name of the employee.
- `age`: The age of the employee.
- `salary`: The salary of the employee.

This class provides methods for string representation and formatted output of employee information.

### EmployeesManager

The `EmployeesManager` class is responsible for managing a list of employees. It offers functionalities to:

- Add a new employee to the list.
- List all existing employees.
- Delete employees within a specified age range.
- Find an employee by their name.
- Update an employee's salary by name.

### FrontendManager

The `FrontendManager` class provides a user interface for interacting with the `EmployeesManager`. Users can perform actions such as:

- Adding new employees.
- Listing existing employees.
- Deleting employees based on age range.
- Updating employee salaries by name.
