# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Python-based command-line application designed to streamline library operations. It utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage books, users, and borrowing activities efficiently.

### Book
The `Book` class represents a book in the library and includes the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the book.
- `name`: Title of the book.
- `quantity`: Number of copies available.

### User
The `User` class represents a library user and includes the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the user.
- `name`: Name of the user.

### Admin
The `Admin` class manages the library system and provides various functionalities, including:

- Adding new books to the library.
- Printing all available books.
- Searching for books by name.
- Adding new users to the system.
- Borrowing books.
- Returning books.
- Printing users who borrowed books.
- Printing all users in the system.
